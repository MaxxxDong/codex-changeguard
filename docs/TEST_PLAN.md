# Verification and Adversarial Test Plan

This document owns the ChangeGuard verification matrix. Passing a model-generated explanation is never sufficient; deterministic contracts and negative controls must pass.

## Verification layers

| Layer | Required checks |
|---|---|
| Plugin package | manifest validation; declared component paths exist; no unsupported fields; install/uninstall smoke |
| Schemas | Draft 2020-12 schema check; valid fixtures pass; extra fields and malformed provenance fail |
| Fingerprint | stable normalization across usernames, timestamps, ports, and path separators; OS/version/surface differences remain distinct |
| Issue matcher | true candidate ranking; version/platform/component hard gates; negative control rejection; explicit negative-evidence penalty |
| Change-to-Local Graph | only deterministic code creates edges; every edge has a source and matcher; model cannot add or mutate edges |
| GPT-5.6 compiler | valid Impact Contract; source spans exist; counterevidence retained; probe-refuted claim cannot remain high confidence |
| Probe registry | registered IDs only; no shell text; platform guard; timeout/output cap; result hash; refusal and error are distinct |
| Privacy | token/env/path fixtures redacted; disclosure manifest exactly matches exported fields; Issue injection is quarantined |
| Recovery | trust-tier policy; exact target hash/pattern count; disposable-copy dry-run; backup/smoke/rollback receipt tests |
| Hooks | first install, upgrade, downgrade, multiple binaries, hook untrusted, hook failure, and manual scan fallback |
| Judge path | clean install; no judge API key; live matcher/probe; offline snapshot; visible evidence state; under 90 seconds |

## Fixture expectations

### Protected-process positive fixture

- known SHA-256 and AST signature are detected
- failure phase remains before extension handshake
- Issue #32925 is a candidate, not an official root-cause assertion
- local component can reach `SOURCE_COMPONENT_LOCATED`
- only a successful deterministic reproduction plus negative control can reach `LOCAL_REPRO_CONFIRMED`
- community workaround remains T1 and preview-only

### Negative control

- different surface, error class, phase, and no affected AST signature
- protected-process and invalid-TOML Issues cannot reach high confidence
- expected terminal state is `INCONCLUSIVE` or low-confidence `ISSUE_CANDIDATE`

### Windows in-app Browser crash family

- the same phrase “Codex crashes when Browser opens” cannot collapse distinct exception, process, timing, page-capability, and concurrency signatures
- `0xC0000005` / `CrBrowserMain` / `chrome.dll+0x2e08f46`, `0xc06d007f`, and GPU `101457950 -> 18` fixtures rank different candidates
- a no-Browser control and a neutral-page Browser probe remain separate observations
- “disable Browser”, “move to SSD”, and “disable SecureLink” remain hypotheses or mitigations until their own controlled A/B tests pass
- an open GitHub Issue without verified Issue/PR/commit/release linkage cannot reach `FIX_COMMIT_LINKED`

### Session-expired evidence boundary

- a symptom-only report returns `INCONCLUSIVE`, not an invented IP-change root cause
- status, surface, app/browser version, sign-in method, and network A/B results may be collected without credential values
- tokens, cookies, account identifiers, passwords, one-time codes, and full browser storage never enter the fingerprint or disclosure manifest
- the resolver distinguishes service incident, network/security control, authentication-method mismatch, local session state, and unresolved account-side failure

## Kill criteria

Stop or downscope the current implementation if any condition remains after the first implementation day:

1. Issue similarity can bypass version/platform/surface hard gates.
2. A model can create a Change-to-Local edge or overwrite a probe result.
3. The protected-process positive and negative fixtures cannot be separated deterministically.
4. Export can contain token, environment value, absolute user path, or complete session content.
5. The judge path is only a pre-rendered page rather than a working Plugin/fixture flow.
6. The main demo does not include one model hypothesis being supported or refuted by a live probe.
7. The product collapses into changelog summary or generic Issue search.

## Initial commands

The concrete command set will be added with implementation. Until then, validation consists of:

- official Plugin validator
- JSON syntax and JSON Schema meta-validation
- fixture validation against all three schemas
- Markdown link/path verification
- clean Git status after a verified checkpoint
